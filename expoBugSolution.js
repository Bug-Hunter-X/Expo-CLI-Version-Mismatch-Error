The solution involves updating the Expo CLI and ensuring compatibility with your project's `package.json` dependencies. Here's how:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Open your terminal and run `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` (or `yarn global add expo-cli`). This updates to the newest Expo CLI version.

2. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully review your `package.json` file.  Make sure all package versions are compatible with the updated Expo CLI.  If there are conflicting versions, update the packages in `package.json`. Use a package manager like npm or yarn to update the packages:
   ```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Clean the cache (if necessary):** If problems persist, try cleaning the project cache. Run `expo prebuild` or manually delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` (or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`).

After completing these steps, try running `expo start` again.  The error should be resolved.
