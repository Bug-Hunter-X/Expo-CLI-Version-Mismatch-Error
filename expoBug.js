This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file.  It often manifests when you try to run `expo start` or other Expo CLI commands.

For example, your project might require a newer version of a dependency than what your current Expo CLI supports. Or, conversely, you might be using an older Expo CLI with a project that requires features only available in a newer version.
