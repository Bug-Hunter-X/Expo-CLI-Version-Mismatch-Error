# Expo CLI Version Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo CLI: version mismatches between the CLI itself and the project dependencies.

## Problem Description

The `expo start` command fails due to conflicts between the Expo CLI version and the versions of packages listed in `package.json`.  This can result in various error messages, often related to missing modules or incompatible versions.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run `expo start`.
3. Observe the error message indicating a version mismatch.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring compatibility between the Expo CLI version and your project's dependencies.  This typically involves:

* **Updating Expo CLI:** Run `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` (or the equivalent for yarn) to update to the latest version.
* **Updating project dependencies:** Check your `package.json` and ensure that the versions of packages are compatible with your Expo CLI version (or update them as needed).
* **Cleaning the cache:**  Sometimes, cached data can interfere. Try `expo prebuild` or deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`).
